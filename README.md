# AI-Powered-Coding-Annotator
AI‑powered web tool that automatically annotates source code with explanations, tags, and structure to help students and developers understand code faster.

AI‑Powered Coding Annotator is a web application that takes source code as input and generates line‑by‑line or block‑level annotations with human‑readable explanations.
It highlights key structures such as functions, loops, conditionals, and classes, and adds tags to indicate logic, potential issues, and best‑practice hints.

The goal of this project is to make code reading easier for beginners, educators, and developers working with unfamiliar codebases.
Users can paste or upload code, view annotated results in the browser, and optionally export the annotated version for documentation or teaching.

Core features
Paste or upload code in supported languages (starting with Python, later Java etc.).

Automatic detection of structures like functions, loops, conditionals, and classes.

Natural‑language explanations for selected lines or blocks of code.

Tags for logic type (loop, condition, I/O), potential issues, and complexity hints.

Clean, interactive UI for viewing and exploring annotations.

Tech stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React).

Backend: Python (Django/Flask/FastAPI).

Parsing: Language parsers / AST processing.

Database: SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL (for storing snippets and history).
